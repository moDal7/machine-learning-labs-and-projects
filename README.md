# machine-learning-labs-and-projects

Code related to the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at Politecnico di Torino, held by professor Sandro Cumani.
The main part is the code related to the final project of the course, where we had to write a report about a classification task of a dataset chosen between three possibilities.

The task was performed using the least possible amount of premade machine learning packages and toolkits, and writing the algorithms ourselves.
